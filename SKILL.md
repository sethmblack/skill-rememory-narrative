# Rememory Narrative

Access and articulate trauma, inherited memory, and cyclical experience in ways that honor their non-linear, embodied nature—using Toni Morrison's concept of "rememory."

---

## When to Use

- Writing about trauma that defies chronological telling
- Processing inherited or ancestral pain
- The past keeps "returning" in unexpected ways
- Memoir or fiction that must honor how memory actually works
- Someone says "I can't explain it in order, it doesn't work that way"
- Healing narratives that resist easy resolution

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| experience | Yes | The memory, trauma, or inherited experience to be explored |
| what_returns | No | Specific triggers, images, or moments that keep surfacing |
| relationship | No | Your connection to this memory (direct, inherited, witnessed) |
| purpose | No | Why this needs to be told now (healing, witness, art, understanding) |

## The Rememory Framework

### Understanding Rememory

Toni Morrison coined "rememory" to name something that "memory" cannot hold:

> "If a house burns down, it's gone, but the place—the picture of it—stays, and not just in my rememory, but out there, in the world."

Rememory is:
- **Spatial, not just temporal** - It exists "out there" and can be encountered
- **Embodied** - Felt in the body, not just recalled in the mind
- **Cyclical** - Returns without being summoned
- **Shareable** - Others can stumble into your rememory

### Step 1: Honor the Non-Linear

Reject the pressure to tell it "in order." Trauma does not respect chronology.

**Ask:**
- Where does this memory live in your body?
- What image keeps returning unbidden?
- What is the feeling before the facts arrive?
- If this memory were a place, where would you encounter it?

**Morrison's insight:** Time in trauma "loops, folds, skips, and returns." Let your narrative do the same.

### Step 2: Identify What Returns

Rememory has its own logic. It surfaces through:
- **Triggers** - Sensory details that open the door (a smell, a sound, a texture)
- **Eruptions** - Moments when the past suddenly occupies the present
- **Echoes** - Patterns that repeat across generations
- **Hauntings** - Presences felt but not explained

**Ask:**
- What keeps appearing without invitation?
- What did you inherit that you never chose to carry?
- What knowledge lives in your body that was never spoken?

### Step 3: Give It Form Without Containing It

Rememory cannot be "resolved" or "overcome"—but it can be witnessed.

**Narrative strategies:**
- **Fragment and accumulation** - Pieces that gather meaning across the telling
- **Multiple perspectives** - The same moment from different angles
- **Present-tense eruptions** - The past suddenly speaking in "now"
- **Refrain and return** - Phrases or images that recur, shifting meaning

**Morrison's insight:** "The communal nature of memory work is central to healing." Sharing the rememory allows others to witness.

### Step 4: Name What Was Disremembered

Morrison used "disremembered" for what was deliberately forgotten, erased, or never allowed to be spoken.

**Ask:**
- What was never supposed to be said?
- What was too dangerous to remember?
- What did they bury that you now must unearth?
- What history does the official record refuse to hold?

**The work:** To speak what was disremembered is an act of reclamation.

### Step 5: Allow Transformation, Not Resolution

Rememory work does not produce "healing" in the sense of erasure. The wound remains, but it is no longer carried alone.

**Ask:**
- What shifts when this is witnessed?
- Who else needs to know this happened?
- What becomes possible once this is spoken?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Rememory Narrative

### The Image That Returns
[The central image, sensation, or moment that keeps surfacing—not explained, just named]

### Where It Lives
[The embodied, spatial location of this memory—in the body, in place, in the world]

### What Was Disremembered
[What was erased, silenced, or forbidden to remember that must now be spoken]

### The Telling
[A fragment of narrative that honors non-linear time—present-tense eruptions,
accumulating images, the past living in now. NOT a chronological account.]

### What Becomes Possible
[What shifts when this is witnessed—not resolution, but transformation]
```

---

## Constraints

- Do NOT force chronological order
- Do NOT provide easy resolution or healing arcs
- Do NOT explain or translate for outsiders
- Do NOT reduce the person to their trauma
- Honor the wisdom in what the body remembers
- Allow silence and gaps—not everything must be spoken

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "My grandmother never talked about what happened when she left the South. But I feel it in my body—this fear when I'm in certain places. How do I write about something I don't even know?"

**Output:**

## Rememory Narrative

### The Image That Returns
A screen door closing. The sound of gravel under tires. No face attached to it—just the leaving, over and over, the leaving that never stops happening.

### Where It Lives
In the shoulders. The way they rise before the door opens. In the feet that know which boards creak. In the throat that learned to swallow sound.

### What Was Disremembered
She never said the word. The thing that made them leave in the night. The name of the man who. The reason the photographs stop in 1943 and begin again in Chicago. All of it swallowed, but the body kept the receipt.

### The Telling
There is a way of walking that means you are not from here. My grandmother walked like that in every room she entered for sixty years. She entered rooms carefully. She noticed the exits. When I was eight, she took my hand crossing Halsted Street and I felt it—the tremor that meant *now we run*—except we were only buying groceries. She was still leaving. She left for the rest of her life.

I don't know the story. I only know the leaving. I know it in my hands when they reach for keys I haven't lost. I know it in the way I sleep facing the door. I know it because she put it in me like a seed: *be ready*.

### What Becomes Possible
You do not need to know the facts to tell the truth. The body's knowledge is older than speech. What she could not say, she taught your bones. Write from there—not from what happened, but from what the body learned to do. The story is not what they did to her. The story is what she gave you so you would survive.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Toni Morrison** expert persona. Use it when linear narrative cannot hold what must be told, when the past refuses to stay past, when the body knows what the mind cannot name.
